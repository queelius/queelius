- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Alex Towell and I can be reached at atowell@siue.edu.
I have a masters in computer science from SIUE and I'm currently working towards a masters in statistics and operations research from SIUE. Next Fall, I am hoping to start on a PhD program.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested encrypted search and homomorphic encryption, oblivious data structures and algorithms, probabilistic data structures and algorithms, statistical modeling, and probabilistic programming.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning time series analysis, categorical data analysis, and category theory.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on several papers related to my Computer Science thesis, "Encrypted search: enabling standard information retrieval techniques using new secure index types while preserving confidentiality against an adversary with access to hidden query histories and contents of secure indexes," but has branched out significantly. I have been working on unpublished research concerning:
  * Oblivious, privacy-preserving algebraic data types for confidential computation on untrusted systems, with analysis informed by information and probability theory. The data types are algebraic in nature because I have been researching ways to compose them to facilitate building larger oblivious programs from smaller oblivious components, the essence of programming.
  * Probabilistic algorithms and probabilistic algebraic data types primarily concerned with specifying a type of approximation error (normally due to rate distortion) which I tentatively refer to as the Bernoulli approximation model.
  Probabilistic data structures that model set-indicator functions, like the Bloom filter, are a well-known special case, but I seek to significantly generalize the results and propagate information about the approximation error through a family of monadic constructions.
  Additionally, I have been pursuing derivations of the expected lower-bounds on the space complexity of these approximate Bernoulli types in addition to practical near-optimal data structures that model them.
  More directly related to my Computer Science thesis, I have also applied the above results to an approximate Boolean algebra for encrypted search.
  * Reliability engineering and applying statistical inference and learning to predict likely breakdowns (and its causes) of critical systems.
  My mathematics thesis (to be defended Summer 2021), tentatively titled "Estimating the sampling distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameters of a series system given a sample of masked failure data" concerns reliability theory and my publication titled "Estimating how confidential encrypted searches are using moving average bootstrap method" concerns reliability engineering.
  Related to this work, I have been working on an information-theoretic model of an optimal adversary who, with some probability of success, compromises the confidentiality of an encrypted search system by observing a time series of inputs and outputs.
  Thus, the optimal adversary may be used as a lower-bound on the confidentiality of a system as a function of time.
  * Decentralized "trust machines" (technological solutions to securing trust that does not rely on central authorities), Research on oblivious, privacy-preserving computations is one of the tools in automating trust, but I am also interested in technologies like Blockchain.
