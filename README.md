## Research

Reliability theory, encrypted search, algebraic structures, complex networks.

- [masked-causes-in-series-systems](https://github.com/queelius/masked-causes-in-series-systems) — likelihood framework for masked failure data
- [encrypted_search_thesis](https://github.com/queelius/encrypted_search_thesis) — IR on encrypted collections
- [bernoulli_sets](https://github.com/queelius/bernoulli_sets) — algebraic theory of random approximate sets, closure properties, applications to encrypted Boolean search
- [cognitive-mri-conversations](https://github.com/queelius/cognitive-mri-conversations) — network analysis of AI conversations (Complex Networks 2025)
- [algebraic.dist](https://github.com/queelius/algebraic.dist) — algebra over distributions in R
- [likelihood.model](https://github.com/queelius/likelihood.model) — composable likelihood framework

## Digital Preservation

I want what I make and collect to outlast me. These are Unix-philosophy CLIs for owning your own data — plain formats, composable through pipes, no dependency on services that might disappear.

| Tool | What |
|------|------|
| arkiv | Universal data archive ([longecho](https://github.com/queelius/longecho) compliant) |
| [longecho](https://github.com/queelius/longecho) | Archival philosophy + tool: self-describing, plaintext-first, graceful degradation. Auto-generates a static site from all decoupled data sources. |
| [repoindex](https://github.com/queelius/repoindex) | Git repo collection index |
| [btk](https://github.com/queelius/btk) | Bookmarks |
| memex | All my AI conversations, searchable and queryable |
| [mtk](https://github.com/queelius/mtk) | Email archives |
| [ptk](https://github.com/queelius/ptk) | Photos |
| [ebk](https://github.com/queelius/ebk) | Ebooks |
| [chartfold](https://github.com/queelius/chartfold) | Personal health data from multiple EHR systems |
| [deets](https://github.com/queelius/deets) | Personal metadata |
| [jot](https://github.com/queelius/jot) | Notes & tasks |
| [crier](https://github.com/queelius/crier) | Cross-posting |
| [jsonl-algebra](https://github.com/queelius/jsonl-algebra) | Relational algebra over JSONL |
| [posthumous](https://github.com/queelius/posthumous) | Deadman switch |
| eidola | Conversable persona from all of the above |

chartfold consolidates my health records from multiple hospital systems into one place. I do a lot of analysis on my own data — trying to spot patterns, understand trends, inform conversations with my doctors. They're the experts; this just helps me be a better-informed patient.

eidola uses arkiv and longecho to auto-package all my data — conversations, writings, emails, bookmarks, photos, reading notes — into a queryable whole (including MCP/SQL). The goal is a simulacrum: something that can represent my thinking after I can't. The [cognitive MRI paper](https://github.com/queelius/cognitive-mri-conversations) is the academic version of the same impulse — mapping the topology of a mind's conversations.

## Encryption & Privacy

My thesis was about searching encrypted data without leaking queries. That research turned practical — I keep building tools for the same problem: keeping things private on infrastructure you don't control.

- [cryptoid](https://github.com/queelius/cryptoid) — Encrypted content and user management for Hugo/static sites
- [pagevault](https://github.com/queelius/pagevault) — Password-protect HTML, Markdown, PDFs, or any content on static hosting. User management, re-keying, renders to a single-file app.
- [bernoulli_sets](https://github.com/queelius/bernoulli_sets) — Theory of random approximate sets underlying encrypted Boolean search
- [encrypted_search_confidentiality](https://github.com/queelius/encrypted_search_confidentiality) — Measuring and maximizing confidentiality in encrypted search
- [boolean-algebra-over-trapdoor-sets](https://github.com/queelius/boolean-algebra-over-trapdoor-sets) — Boolean algebra on trapdoor sets for oblivious computing

## AI Tools

I build a lot of tooling for working with AI — Claude Code plugins, MCP servers, agent workflows.

- [alex-claude-plugins](https://github.com/queelius/alex-claude-plugins) — Plugin suite: papermill (academic writing), pub-pipeline (publication), worldsmith (fiction), repoindex, mf (site management), deets, locksmith
- eidola — Persona generation from personal data archives
- [cognitive-mri-conversations](https://github.com/queelius/cognitive-mri-conversations) — Network topology of AI conversations
